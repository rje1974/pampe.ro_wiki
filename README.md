Here we will be putting the work that is generating the reactions to the topics organized by weeks that the startupschool course is throwing at us. We are going to do it in English because it is easier now than to translate later.

## Week 1
### Kevin Hale - How to Evaluate Startup Ideas pt. 1
Taking the info from the transcription and the pdf and making point in the part about that this startup is a hipotesis, lets hipotesisase. https://www.startupschool.org/videos/62

* **Problem.** Weather information for farmers sucks.The way that agriculture weather info is delivered to farmers didn't change in the last 10 years. The newst thing are the APIs and some IOT initiatives. All of them are heavyly centrated in forecast, they don't give a good insight about what happened. For farmer it's as important to know how much rained last night, than how much will rain tomorrow and that's becouse when you are taking desitions you use the info that happened and what will happen. For delivering the info of what happened (expecially rain fall) you need to have a weather station, and to do this masively, you need to build a network of them and operate them.


* **Solution**. Build a new concept arround Ag weather: A network of free weather stations and chatbots, all supported by a comunity. You want to have a waether station, we will give it to you for free and deliver you quiality information throug a chatbot in a whatsapp group.

* **Insight.** Currently in Argentina there are whatsapp groups that are used to communicate how much it has rained. Most of this information comes from analog publiometers (manual records), very little from meteorological stations and none from IOT. The birth and raise of these groups demonstrates how valuable this information is and why members are willing to share it, with the expectation of obtaining information that allows them to make better decisions in a broader geographical context. The IOT necessary to achieve this is in the range of less than 1000 u$s per unit. Systematizing the handling of this information is the key to entering the smartphone of the people, who are part of the agricultural and livestock sector, because when solving this through a chatbot we get into your communication system and we are not only an app. The will to create and attend this community in an open way is one of the most important tools.
4. This are our unfair advantages:
  * We are willing and have the means to create groups and networks.
  * We are willing to work in the field.
  * We are willing to provide that infrastructure to the community for free.
  * We are willing to provide the information for free.
  * We can commit to a very simple and low cost structure in the early stages.

## Weather chatbots

### An example

### The main problem.
It's that nobody uses telegram and you have to build it for whasatpp

### The solution.
Put a human.
