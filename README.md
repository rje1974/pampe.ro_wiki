Kevin Hale - How to Evaluate Startup Ideas pt. 1
Taking the info from the transcription and the pdf and making point in the part about that this startup is a hipotesis, lets hipotesisase.

1. Problem. Ag Weather suck in 2020.The way that agriculture weather info is delivered to farmers didn't change in the last 10 years. The newst thing are the APIs and some IOT initiatives. All of them are heavyly centrated in forecast, they don't give a good insight about what happened. For farmer it's as important to know how much rained last night, than how much will rain tomorrow and that's becouse when you are taking desitions you use the info that happened and what will happen. For delivering the info of what happened (expecially rain fall) you need to have a weather station, and to do this masively, you need to build a network of them and operate them
2. Solution. Build a new concept arround Ag weather: A network of free weather stations and chatbots, all supported by a comunity. You want to have a waether station, we will give it to you for free and deliver you quiality information throug a chatbot in a whatsapp group.
